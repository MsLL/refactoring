note1 为什么要重构：

1.代码写的烂 2.很多时候没法保证design一开始就是对的。

I’ve been working with objects for more than a decade, but I still never get it right the first time. That used to bother me, but now I realize that I can use refactoring to change my mind in these cases.	p141。

note2 重构的意义在于：你永远不必说对不起--只要把出问题的地方修补好就行了。

Refactoring means you never have to say you’re sorry—you just fix it.	p160。
